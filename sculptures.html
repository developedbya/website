                <h4><i>Wired Sculpture</i></h4>
                <br>
                <p>"The Lost Fish" features a fish sculpture crafted from aluminum wire. Suspended from a separate wire stand, the sculpture gives the illusion of the fish gracefully floating or swimming in mid-air. The use of aluminum wire, commonly associated with fishing, adds a symbolic touch. The title itself, "The Lost Fish," evokes a feeling of loss, as if the fish has been removed from its natural habitat. This piece invites viewers to reflect on the impact of human actions on nature and its consequences.</p>
                <br>
                <p>This sculpture was featured at the Pace University Art Gallery in 2023 as part of the Annual Art Student Exhibition. This exhibition showcased the talent of 38 individual student artists, along with various course projects.</p>

                <h4><i>Clay Sculpture</i></h4>
                <br>
                <p>This clay sculpture combines a cat's head with a turtle's body. Painted in a dark green hue, the sculpture acquires an antique appearance, reminiscent of ancient artifacts. The subtle aging effect adds an aura of mystery and history to the artwork, as if it were from a long-lost civilization.</p>

The design forms beautiful lines and shapes, making it a visual delight. This artwork shows the creativity that can be achieved with simple materials like toothpicks.</p>
