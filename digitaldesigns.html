                <br>
                <h4><i>Designed using: Adobe Photoshop</i></h4>
                <br>
                <p>In an old New York City subway cart, a girl sits amidst a garden of roses. The girl's gaze, directed away from the garden, adds a touch of mystery to the piece, as if she is unaware of the presence of the flowers. Symbolically, some of the roses are depicted in black and white, contributing to the vintage aesthetic and emphasizing the passage of time. "Subway Garden" draws inspiration from the artist Gregory Crewdson, capturing his evocative storytelling. This piece invites viewers to reflect on the beauty that often goes unnoticed in an urban landscape.</p>

                <br>
                <p>“Lollipop Pop” draws inspiration from the iconic style of Andy Warhol. In this piece, a girl is holding a lollipop to her lip, symbolizing a sense of youth. The use of vibrant colors throughout four squares adds a dynamic and eye-catching element to the composition. Each square showcases a different color palette, contributing to the overall energetic and pop art-inspired aesthetic.</p>

                <p>This digital illustration of a Scottie dog incorporates geometric shapes into its design. The use of solid colors and various shades adds depth and shadows, giving the dog a realistic appearance. The different geometric elements come together, highlighting the dog's features and giving the illustration a modern feel.</p>

                <h4><i>Designed using: Adobe Photoshop</i></h4>
                <br>
                <p>This still life design has an old-fashioned feel, with warm colors dominating the scene and an artistic touch that resembles a painting. In the center, a crystal decanter catches the light and creates shadows. Around it, you'll find an apple, orange, and flowers. The flowers match the colors of the apple and orange, making the arrangement feel balanced. Everything sits on a cream fabric, giving it an elegant touch. The use of shadows adds realism to the design.</p>

                <br>
                <h4><i>Designed using: Adobe Photoshop</i></h4>
                <br>
                <p>This design is inspired by Picasso. The warm, antique tones of the image create a contrast with the modern setting and appearance of the girl. The image is intentionally broken up into different shapes and angles inspired by Picasso's famous cubist style. This technique gives the artwork a unique and abstract look. By incorporating cubism, the artwork encourages us to see the girl and her surroundings from different viewpoints simultaneously. It challenges traditional ideas of how things should look and invites us to think about the complexity of human experiences.</p>
